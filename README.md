# Project Overview
In the competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is crucial. This project
builds a Customer Churn Prediction model trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
The model helps predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay based on factors such as:
Tenure (Months as a customer)
Internet Service Type
Contract Type
Monthly Charges
Total Charges
The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface where users can input customer details and get real-time predictions.
